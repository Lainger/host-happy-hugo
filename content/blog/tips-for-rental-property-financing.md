Purchasing a rental property can be a great way to build equity and use rental income to help service your mortgage debt.  If you are considering purchasing a rental property there a number of things to consider when it comes to financing.

If you are looking to purchase a property with multiple units and occupy one of the units, financing may be available up to 95% as this would be considered owner occupied.  This 95% option is available for 1-2 unit properties.  For 2-4 unit properties the maximum financing is 90%. 

If the property is not for personal use and is going to be used solely as a rental/investment, the downpayment requirement is 20%.  This change to a minimum downpayment of 20% on rental only units was made back in 2010. Prior to that you could purchase rental units with less than 20% down.

Most of the major bank and credit union lenders offer rental mortgage options with 20% down or more. There are varying criteria depending on which institution you are dealing with, that is why it is important to deal with a mortgage professional who knows what each lender has to offer.

Lately, rental property mortgages generally come with a slight premium on rate.  TD for example adds 5 basis points to their 5 year fixed mortgage rate on rental units.  Again, this can vary from bank to bank so it is important to check out all of your options.

A mortgage broker can provide a detailed breakdown of what you can afford based on the lending guidelines of multiple institutions so it is best to talk to a professional before starting your search.

The company was previously known as Hingston + Co. but has been given a complete rebrand — including a new logo, tap badges, website and branded material — by London-based design studio & Smith. The new identity is based on the Kandinsky abstract painting, Black Lines, and true to its name, is mostly black and white with a few flashes of colour. According to & Smith, the identity brings together “art and science” and has been brought to life through collaborations with nine illustrators.

Black Lines wants it to be as easy to serve a Negroni as it is a pint of lager. The drinks company is seeking to revolutionise the bar experience by serving cocktails by draught with a changing menu of drinks (as well as same favourite stand-bys). A pink grapefruit spritz was served through the summer while a new pear and white tea fizz joins the line-up for winter.
